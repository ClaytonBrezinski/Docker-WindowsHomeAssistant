# Docker-WindowsHomeAssistant
This is a home assistant installation for the ENSE 483 class held within a Docker Container

The extensions to the base install of home assistant are:
1. A machine learning algorithm that analyzes the history of a users
travel within the home over a long time span, and then alerts
admin/subscribing users of suspicious activity, such as when a user does
 not normally follow their regular patterns when entering the home.
2. A visualization system that will display to admin/subscribing users
the amount of times that a wireless device has seen the wireless device
you are currently viewing the home-assistant dashboard on.
